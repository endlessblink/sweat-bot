## Current Focus: MVP Feature Prioritization

### Analysis as Product Manager

Based on the comprehensive project brief and user needs, I'm prioritizing the MVP features:

#### Immediate Priorities (Sprint 1)
1. **Chat-First Interface** - Core value proposition
2. **Hebrew Voice Recognition** - Key differentiator
3. **Exercise Logging** - Primary utility
4. **Basic Statistics** - User feedback loop

#### Deferred to Sprint 2
- Nutrition tracking from photos
- Social gamification features
- Advanced analytics

### User Story Refinement

**Story: Voice Exercise Logging**
As a Hebrew-speaking CrossFit athlete,
I want to log my workout by speaking naturally in Hebrew,
So that I don't interrupt my workout flow.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Voice input accepts natural Hebrew phrases
- System confirms understanding before saving
- Works in noisy gym environment
- Provides audio feedback in Hebrew

### Success Metrics
- Voice recognition accuracy > 90%
- Exercise logging time < 5 seconds
- User retention after 7 days > 60%
