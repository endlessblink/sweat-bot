## 🚀 Squad Commands

```bash
# Full initialization
npm run squad:init

# Analyze codebase
npm run squad:analyze

# Sync role communications
npm run squad:sync

# Create new feature
npm run squad:feature "Feature Name"

# Check squad status
npm run squad:status
```

## 📊 Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Squad directory structure created
- All 4 roles defined and configured
- Communication protocols established
- Feature planning document created
- Custom initialization script implemented
- Codebase analyzed

### ⚠️ Active Blockers
- **Frontend**: Waiting for API endpoint specifications
- **AI**: Model size optimization needed (5GB)
- **QA**: No test environment set up yet

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Backend**: Create FastAPI project with initial endpoints
2. **Frontend**: Set up Next.js with Hebrew UI components
3. **AI**: Optimize Whisper model loading
4. **QA**: Initialize Jest testing framework

### Week 1 Goals
- [ ] Basic API structure
- [ ] Voice recording UI
- [ ] Hebrew command parsing
- [ ] Unit test coverage

## 📝 Working with Squad

### Creating a Feature
```bash
npm run squad:feature "Voice Command Processing"
```

This creates a feature document and updates all role communication files.

### Updating Progress
Edit the relevant `role-comm-*.md` file in `.squad/` directory:
- Mark tasks as completed
- Add blockers if encountered
- Document completed items

### Syncing Team
```bash
npm run squad:sync
```
Reviews all communication files and identifies blockers.

## 🔄 Workflow

1. **Analyze** → Understand current state
2. **Plan** → Define features in squad docs
3. **Communicate** → Update role-comm files
4. **Sync** → Coordinate between roles
5. **Evaluate** → Check progress and blockers
