## 🔄 BMAD Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning (Days 1-2)
```
Analyst → Product Manager → Architect
   ↓           ↓              ↓
Requirements   PRD      Architecture
```

### Phase 2: Sprint Planning (Day 3)
```
Scrum Master reads PRD & Architecture
         ↓
Creates Development Stories
         ↓
Assigns to Development Team
```

### Phase 3: Development (Days 4-8)
```
Developer implements stories
         ↓
QA Engineer validates
         ↓
Product Manager reviews
```

### Phase 4: Review (Day 9)
```
All agents sync
      ↓
Update documentation
      ↓
Plan next sprint
```

## 🔗 Integration with Squad Engineering

BMAD agents are mapped to Squad roles:

| Squad Role | BMAD Agent | Responsibility |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| Backend | Developer | API, Database, WebSocket |
| Frontend | Developer | UI, Hebrew RTL, Voice |
| AI | Architect | Models, Hebrew processing |
| QA | QA Engineer | Testing, Validation |

### Synchronization
```bash
# Sync BMAD with Squad
node .bmad-core/integration/squad-bmad-bridge.js sync

# Generate stories from PRD
node .bmad-core/integration/squad-bmad-bridge.js generate

# Create unified dashboard
node .bmad-core/integration/squad-bmad-bridge.js dashboard
```

## 🏃 Using BMAD for Development

### 1. View Current Status
```bash
# Check dashboard
cat BMAD-SQUAD-DASHBOARD.md

# Check agent status
cat .bmad-core/status.json
```

### 2. Create New Feature
```bash
# Add to PRD
edit .bmad-core/docs/PRD.md

# Generate story
node .bmad-core/integration/squad-bmad-bridge.js generate
```

### 3. Update Progress
```bash
# Update story status
edit .bmad-core/stories/SWEAT-XXX.md

# Sync with Squad
node .bmad-core/integration/squad-bmad-bridge.js sync
```

## 💪 Fitness Domain Expansion Pack

The fitness domain expansion pack (`.bmad-core/expansion-packs/fitness-domain.yaml`) provides:

### Domain Knowledge
- Exercise types with Hebrew translations
- Workout structures (HIIT, Strength, CrossFit)
- Nutrition tracking guidelines
- Gamification mechanics

### Hebrew Patterns
```yaml
exercise_commands:
  - "עשיתי 20 סקוואטים"  # I did 20 squats
  - "50 קילו בק סקווט"   # 50kg back squat
  - "סיימתי אימון"       # Finished workout
```

### Point System
```yaml
exercises:
  pushup: 2 points/rep
  squat: 3 points/rep
  burpee: 5 points/rep
  running: 10 points/km
```

## 📊 Current Sprint Status

### Sprint Goal
Complete MVP features for Hebrew fitness tracking

### Active Stories
