Continue Points System v4.0 - Phase 2: API Integration & Testing

CONTEXT:
Phase 1 is complete (49% of total project). I have:
âœ… Database schema deployed (18 tables, 50 achievements, 13 exercises)
âœ… Calculation engine built (formulas, bonuses, multipliers, fraud detection)
âœ… Achievement system ready (JSON condition parser, NO eval!)
âœ… Comprehensive PRD and E2E test plan
âœ… All code committed (6 commits on branch: feature/points-system-v3-rebuild)

WHAT'S WORKING:
- Database: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM achievement_definition; returns 50
- Calculation Engine: backend/app/services/points_v4/engine.py (ready to use)
- Formulas: All 3 types (strength, cardio, core) implemented
- Models: backend/app/models/points_models_v4.py (SQLAlchemy)

REQUIRED READING BEFORE YOU START:
1. SESSION-SUMMARY-2025-10-12.md (complete Phase 1 context)
2. docs/main-docs/POINTS_SYSTEM_V4_PRD.md (Section 4.7: API specifications)
3. backend/app/services/points_v4/README.md (usage examples)
4. docs/testing/POINTS_V4_E2E_TEST_PLAN.md (15 test scenarios)

YOUR MISSION - PHASE 2 (22 tasks remaining):
Build the integration layer that connects the calculation engine to users:

PRIORITY 1: API Endpoints (Week 2)
- POST /v1/activities (log exercise, calculate points, save to DB)
- GET /v1/users/{id}/summary (stats with current level, streak, points)
- GET /v1/users/{id}/achievements (with progress bars and ETA)
- GET /v1/leaderboards (all scopes: all_time, weekly, monthly, friends)

PRIORITY 2: Unit Tests (Week 2)
- test_strength_formulas.py (edge cases: zero reps, 500kg weight)
- test_cardio_formulas.py (pace clamps 0.6-1.4, elevation bonuses)
- test_bonus_system.py (variety, overload, PR detection)
- test_multiplier_system.py (stacking, 1.25 global cap)
- test_fraud_detection.py (unrealistic values flagged)
- test_conditions.py (all 8 condition types)
Target: >90% coverage on calculation engine

PRIORITY 3: Event-Driven Architecture (Week 2-3)
- Setup Celery with Redis broker
- Define domain events (activity.logged, points.calculated, achievement.unlocked)
- Celery workers: update_stats, update_streak, check_achievements, refresh_leaderboards
- Event publisher to Redis queue

PRIORITY 4: Integration Tests (Week 3)
- test_api_activities.py (POST /v1/activities validates correctly)
- test_achievement_unlock.py (threshold triggers unlock)
- Verify database state after operations

PRIORITY 5: E2E Tests with Playwright (Week 3)
- Scenario 1: First-time user journey
- Scenario 4: Personal record tracking
- Scenario 5: Achievement progress bars
- Scenario 8: Fraud detection
- Scenario 15: Complete user flow
(Reference: docs/testing/POINTS_V4_E2E_TEST_PLAN.md for all 15 scenarios)

CRITICAL RULES (from CLAUDE.md):
1. NEVER claim functionality works without ACTUAL E2E TESTING
2. NO demo data - test with real user input only
3. Update Like I Said tasks as you progress
4. Use Doppler for all secrets: doppler run -- ...
5. Follow infrastructure-first debugging if issues arise

TECH STACK REMINDER:
- Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.11) on port 8000
- Database: PostgreSQL (port 8001), MongoDB (port 8002), Redis (port 8003)
- Frontend: Vite + React (port 8005)
- Testing: pytest (unit/integration) + Playwright MCP (E2E)
- Queue: Celery with Redis broker

EXAMPLE API ENDPOINT TO BUILD:
POST /v1/activities
Request:
{
  "exercise_key": "squat",
  "started_at": "2025-10-12T10:00:00Z",
  "ended_at": "2025-10-12T10:15:00Z",
  "metrics": {
    "sets": 3,
    "reps": [10, 8, 8],
    "weights": [50, 55, 55]
  }
}

Response:
{
  "activity_id": 12345,
  "points": {
    "total": 195,
    "breakdown": {
      "base_points": 150,
      "bonuses": {"set_completion": 6, "weight": 30},
      "multipliers": {"streak": 1.05, "total": 1.05}
    },
    "display_text": "You earned 195 points: 150 base + 36 bonuses Ã— 1.05 streak"
  },
  "streak": {"current": 8, "best": 22},
  "achievements_unlocked": [
    {"key": "first_workout", "name_en": "First Steps", "points_reward": 25}
  ]
}

HOW TO USE THE CALCULATION ENGINE:
from app.services.points_v4.engine import PointsEngine

result = await PointsEngine.calculate_activity_points(
    user_id="uuid",
    exercise_key="squat",
    activity_data={"sets": 3, "reps": [10,8,8], "weights": [50,55,55]},
    user_context={"streak_days": 8}
)

# Save to database
calculation = PointsCalculation(
    activity_id=activity.id,
    user_id=user_id,
    exercise_type_id=exercise_type_id,
    base_points=result.breakdown.base_points,
    bonus_points=sum(result.breakdown bonuses),
    multiplier=result.breakdown.total_multiplier,
    breakdown_json=PointsEngine.generate_breakdown_json(result)
)
db.add(calculation)
await db.commit()

DATABASE VERIFICATION BEFORE YOU START:
Run these to confirm Phase 1 is deployed:
```
psql -h localhost -p 8001 -U fitness_user -d hebrew_fitness
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM exercise_type;           -- Should return 13
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM achievement_definition;  -- Should return 50
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'activity_%';  -- Should return 4
\q
```

TESTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Write unit tests ALONGSIDE implementation (not after!)
- Use pytest with async support
- Test edge cases: zero reps, massive weights, unrealistic paces
- Verify fraud detection flags correctly
- E2E tests use Playwright MCP with real browser
- Take screenshots and save to docs/screenshots-debug/points-v4-tests/

SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR PHASE 2:
âœ… API endpoints implemented and tested
âœ… >90% test coverage on calculation engine
âœ… Celery workers processing events asynchronously
âœ… At least 5 E2E scenarios passing with Playwright
âœ… No eval() anywhere (maintain security)
âœ… Performance: <50ms point calculations verified
