## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Page not loading"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check frontend is running
curl http://localhost:8006

# Restart frontend if needed
cd personal-ui-vite && doppler run -- npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Can't log exercises"
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Restart backend if needed
cd backend && doppler run -- python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Issue: "No 'Add to Home Screen' button"
**Causes:**
- Using HTTP instead of HTTPS (use Cloudflare tunnel URL, not localhost)
- Already installed (check home screen for SweatBot icon)
- iOS: Must use Safari (not Chrome)
- Android: Must use Chrome (not Firefox)

### Issue: "App not working in standalone mode"
**Solution:**
- Check that backend and frontend are still running
- Check that Cloudflare tunnel is still active
- Try closing and reopening the PWA app
