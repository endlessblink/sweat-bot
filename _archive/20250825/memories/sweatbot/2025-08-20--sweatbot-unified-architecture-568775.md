---## SweatBot Unified Architecture - SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION (Aug 20, 2025)

**COMPLETED CONSOLIDATION**: Successfully removed all redundant services and created unified single-service architecture with working runtime fallback.

### ✅ STANDARDIZED PORT ALLOCATION (8000-8005 ONLY):
- **Port 8000**: Main SweatBot Backend (FastAPI with runtime fallback)
- **Port 8002**: Personal SweatBot UI (Vite frontend) 
- **Port 8001, 8003-8005**: Available for additional services

### ✅ RUNTIME FALLBACK WORKING PERFECTLY:
**Test Results Confirmed**:
- Gemini 1.5 Flash quota exceeded (429 error)
- System automatically fell back to Groq Llama3-70B
- User received proper Hebrew AI response instead of API error message
- Frontend shows working chat instead of "בעיה במפתחות API של Gemini 1.5 Flash"

### ✅ TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED:
1. **Fixed CORS Configuration**: Updated backend config.py to include port 8002
2. **Updated Vite Config**: Set strictPort: true for port 8002
3. **Runtime Fallback**: PersonalSweatBotWithTools with multi-agent fallback chain
4. **Service Consolidation**: Killed redundant backends, single unified system
5. **Documentation**: Updated CLAUDE.md with standardized port allocation

### ✅ WORKING SERVICES:
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000 (with runtime fallback)
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8002 (working chat interface)
- **Status**: Production ready, no API error messages shown to users

### ✅ LOGS PROOF:
```
🔄 Trying Gemini 1.5 Flash...
❌ Gemini 1.5 Flash failed: 429 You exceeded your current quota
🔄 Recoverable error with Gemini 1.5 Flash, trying next model...
