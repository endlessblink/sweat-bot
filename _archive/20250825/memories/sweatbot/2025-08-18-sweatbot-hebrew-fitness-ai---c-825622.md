---SweatBot Hebrew Fitness AI - Complete Model Cleanup and Optimization (August 18, 2025)

COMPLETED PROJECT: Successfully removed unwanted models from SweatBot's Ollama container and optimized the entire system configuration.

## What Was Accomplished
✅ Removed Llama 3.2 (3B) and Gemma 2 (2B) models from dropdown and container
✅ Reclaimed 3.6GB storage space (from 13.9GB to 10.3GB total)
✅ Eliminated all hardcoded Hebrew content that was causing conversation resets
✅ Updated all configuration files for consistency
✅ Physically cleaned up orphaned model blobs using `ollama rm` commands
✅ Verified system functionality with only intended models

## Final System State
- **Working Directory**: /home/endlessblink/sweatbot-backend
- **Current Models**: bjoernb/gemma3n-e2b:latest (5.6GB) + llava:7b (4.7GB)
- **Container Status**: Running and optimized
- **API Response**: Clean model list with no deprecated references

## Key Configuration Files Updated
- ollama-models.txt: Essential models only
- scripts/ollama-entrypoint.sh: Updated downloads
- .env.docker: Clean model references
- docker-compose.full.yml: Production config
- All setup scripts: No deprecated model references

## Architecture Status
- FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL + Redis + MongoDB
- Hebrew AI models properly configured
- WebSocket real-time communication working
- Model state persistence via Redis ModelStateManager
- No hardcoded content remaining

## User Preferences Captured

- Eliminate all hardcoded content
- Optimize storage space
- Maintain only essential Hebrew and vision models
- Keep system responsive and clean
