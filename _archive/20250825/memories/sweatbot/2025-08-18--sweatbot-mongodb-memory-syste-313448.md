---## SweatBot MongoDB Memory System Implementation - COMPLETED

Successfully implemented a comprehensive memory system for SweatBot that makes it a "self-improving AI bot that remembers important content and saves all the data and can retrieve it whenever needed" as requested.

### Key Achievements:

1. **Fixed Model Selection Persistence**
   - Created Redis-based ModelStateManager that persists model selection across sessions
   - Fixed conversational agent to actually use selected models (Gemini, Groq, Ollama)
   - Prevented unwanted fallbacks to Ollama when other models are selected
   - Model selection now persists for 7 days in Redis

2. **MongoDB Memory System**
   - Added MongoDB service to Docker Compose (port 27017)
   - Created comprehensive memory models:
     - UserProfile: Stores user preferences, fitness level, goals
     - WorkoutMemory: Complete workout sessions with exercises
     - PersonalRecord: Tracks personal bests with improvements
     - ConversationMemory: Stores all conversations with intent tracking
     - UserInsight: AI-generated insights about user patterns
     - Goal: User fitness goals with progress tracking

3. **Memory Service Layer**
   - Implemented full CRUD operations for all memory types
   - Automatic personal record detection and tracking
   - Workout statistics aggregation (30-day summaries)
   - Conversation search capabilities
   - Goal progress tracking

4. **Conversational Agent Integration**
   - Agent now loads full memory context before responding
   - Includes user profile, recent workouts, PRs, goals in prompts
   - Stores every conversation in MongoDB with model tracking
   - Automatically generates insights based on user patterns
   - Detects favorite exercises and workout consistency

### Technical Implementation:
- MongoDB connection: mongodb://sweatbot:secure_password@mongodb:27017
- Database: sweatbot_fitness
- Collections: users, workouts, personal_records, conversations, user_insights, goals
- Motor library for async MongoDB operations
- Full integration with existing Redis and PostgreSQL systems

### Testing Status:
✅ MongoDB container running and healthy
✅ Backend connects successfully to MongoDB
✅ Memory models validated
✅ Service layer implemented
✅ Conversational agent integrated
✅ System fully operational

The bot now truly remembers everything and improves over time!
