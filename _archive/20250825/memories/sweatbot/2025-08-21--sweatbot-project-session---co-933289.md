---# SweatBot Project Session - Complete Status & Memory

## Project Overview: SweatBot Hebrew Fitness AI Assistant

**Location**: `/mnt/d/MY PROJECTS/AI/LLM/AI Code Gen/my-builds/Automation-Bots/sweatbot`

**Current Architecture**: Modern hybrid system with FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend, Docker Compose orchestration
- **Backend**: Python 3.11 (for asyncpg compatibility), FastAPI with Phidata AI agents
- **Frontend**: Next.js/Vite on port 8004 (personal-ui-vite directory)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (exercise data), MongoDB (conversations), Redis (cache)
- **AI Framework**: Phidata with tool-based architecture for natural language processing

## CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENT: Fixed Core AI Agent Issue ✅

**Problem Solved**: SweatBot AI agent wasn't calling database tools consistently to show real statistics
**Root Cause**: Async execution conflict in Phidata framework between agent context and asyncio database operations
**Solution**: Implemented synchronous execution pattern in `src/agents/tools/statistics_retriever.py` using controlled event loops
**Result**: Tool now successfully retrieves real data (3,113 points, 46 exercises, 1,675 reps) consistently

## MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL UPDATE: Standardized Port Scheme ✅

**User Request**: "Why aren't they set on the same 8000-8010 limit?" - questioned scattered port allocation
**Solution**: Completely standardized ALL services to 8000-8010 range:
- 8000 → Backend API (FastAPI)
- 8001 → PostgreSQL Database (your 3,113 points)
- 8002 → MongoDB (conversation storage)
- 8003 → Redis Cache
- 8004 → Frontend (Next.js/Vite)
- 8005-8010 → Reserved for expansion

**Benefits**: Professional microservices architecture, no Palladio conflicts, easy firewall rules, consistent management

## Docker Network Conflict - JUST FIXED ✅

**Issue**: `failed to create network sweatbot_sweatbot_network: Error response from daemon: invalid pool request: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space`
**Cause**: Hardcoded subnet 172.20.0.0/16 conflicting with existing network `sweatbot-backend_sweatbot-network`
**Fix Applied**: 
1. Removed hardcoded subnet from docker-compose.yml (let Docker auto-assign)
2. Added network cleanup to launch script
3. Enhanced with orphaned network removal

## Current System Status

**Working Components**:
- ✅ AI agent tool execution (real database queries working)
- ✅ PostgreSQL with 3,113 points preserved
- ✅ MongoDB conversation persistence
- ✅ Tool-based architecture with 6 specialized tools
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration with proper service grouping
- ✅ Standardized 8000-8010 port allocation
- ✅ Network conflict resolution

**Available Scripts**:
- `./launch-sweatbot-compose.sh` - Full Docker Compose launch (JUST FIXED)
- `./restart-sweatbot.sh` - Quick restart using existing packages
- `./check-sweatbot-status.sh` - Comprehensive status checker
- `./install-all-dependencies.sh` - Full Python dependency installer

**Key Files**:
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Updated with 8000-8010 ports, network fix
- `/src/agents/personal_sweatbot_with_tools.py` - Current AI agent (tool-based)
- `/src/agents/tools/statistics_retriever.py` - Fixed database tool with sync execution
- `/backend/venv/` - Working Python 3.11 virtual environment
- `/personal-ui-vite/` - Frontend on port 8004

## User Preferences & Requirements Captured

1. **Port Organization**: All services must use 8000-8010 range for consistency
2. **Data Preservation**: Never lose the 3,113 points and exercise history
3. **Service Grouping**: All containers should be grouped properly (Docker Compose)
4. **No Reinstallation**: Use existing working packages when possible
5. **Full Features**: "I want all features. This is needed for actual usage"
6. **Python 3.13 Avoidance**: Use Python 3.11 in containers due to asyncpg compatibility

## Technical Context

**Python Environment**: 3.13 on host (causes asyncpg issues), 3.11 in containers
**Package Status**: All dependencies installed in backend/venv/ (working)
**Database Connection**: Using tool-based sync execution pattern to avoid async conflicts
**Port Conflicts**: Resolved by moving away from Palladio's traditional database ports

## What Just Happened

1. **Started session continuation** from previous work on SweatBot async fixes
2. **User questioned port allocation**: "why aren't they set on the same 8000-8010 limit?"
3. **Implemented complete standardization** to 8000-8010 range
4. **Updated Docker Compose** with new port scheme
5. **User tried launch script** - encountered network conflict
6. **Diagnosed network issue**: hardcoded subnet conflict
7. **Fixed network configuration** - removed subnet, added cleanup
8. **Ready for testing** - script should now work properly
