---## SweatBot Model Cleanup - Complete Storage Optimization

Successfully removed unwanted models from the SweatBot project and reclaimed significant storage space.

### ✅ Storage Reclaimed: ~3.6GB

**Models Removed:**
- **gemma2:2b**: ~1.6GB (outdated, replaced by Enhanced Gemma3n E2B)
- **llama3.2:3b**: ~2.0GB (not used, removed from dropdown earlier)

**Final Model Configuration:**
- **bjoernb/gemma3n-e2b:latest**: 5.6GB (Enhanced Hebrew model - kept)
- **llava:7b**: 4.7GB (Vision model for form analysis - kept)
- **Total storage**: ~10.3GB (down from ~13.9GB)

### ✅ Complete Configuration Updates:

1. **Container Cleanup:**
   - Removed models from Ollama: `ollama rm gemma2:2b` & `ollama rm llama3.2:3b`
   - Automatic blob cleanup (no orphaned data remaining)
   - Verified only intended models remain in container

2. **Configuration Files Updated:**
   - `ollama-models.txt`: Updated essential models list
   - `scripts/download-models.sh`: Changed model check to `bjoernb/gemma3n-e2b`
   - `scripts/ollama-entrypoint.sh`: Updated primary model downloads
   - `setup-ollama.sh`: Updated to use Enhanced Gemma3n E2B
   - `setup-dictalm.sh`: Updated fallback model references

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   - `.env.docker`: Changed `LLM_TEXT_MODEL` to `bjoernb/gemma3n-e2b:latest`
   - `docker-compose.full.yml`: Updated `OLLAMA_MODEL` environment variable

### ✅ API Verification:
- Model dropdown now shows only: Gemma3n E2B, LLaVA, Gemini Flash/Pro
- No references to removed models remain
- System continues to function with dynamic model selection

### ✅ Benefits:
- **3.6GB storage space reclaimed** 
- **Faster container startup** (fewer models to initialize)
- **Cleaner configuration** (no deprecated model references)
- **Better model selection** (only high-quality, actively used models)

The project is now optimized with only the essential, high-performance models while maintaining full functionality.
