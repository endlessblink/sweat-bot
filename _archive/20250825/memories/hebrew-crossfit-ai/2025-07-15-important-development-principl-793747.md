---Important Development Principle: Always Add, Never Remove Features

Key lesson learned: When implementing new features, always merge them into the existing system without removing any previous functionality unless explicitly directed to do so.

❌ What I did wrong:
- Created a separate "enhanced" version that was missing original features
- Lost some UI elements from the original desktop_app.py
- Missing comprehensive statistics window
- Missing history window  
- Missing threshold control
- Missing some animations and UI polish

✅ What I should do:
- Merge new weight tracking features INTO the existing desktop_app.py
- Keep all original functionality intact
- Add new features as enhancements to existing features
- Preserve all UI elements and user experience
- Only remove features if explicitly asked to do so

This ensures users don't lose functionality they were already using and expect to continue working.
