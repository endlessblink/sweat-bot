---Hebrew CrossFit AI - Exercise Tracking and Statistics Implementation

## New Features Added:

### 1. Exercise Tracker Module (exercise_tracker.py):
- **SQLite Database Storage**: Persistent storage of all workout data
- **ExerciseEntry**: Individual exercise records with timestamp, reps, points
- **WorkoutSession**: Complete workout sessions with start/end times
- **Automatic Session Management**: Auto-starts sessions when exercises detected

### 2. Database Schema:
```sql
workout_sessions table:
- session_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- date, start_time, end_time
- total_points, duration_minutes, notes

exercises table:
- id (AUTO INCREMENT)
- session_id (FOREIGN KEY)
- exercise, exercise_he, reps, weight, duration
- points, timestamp
```

### 3. Enhanced Statistics System:
- **Daily Stats**: Sessions, points, duration, exercise breakdown
- **Weekly Stats**: Weekly totals, daily breakdown, top exercises
- **Personal Records**: Max reps per exercise, max weights
- **Streak Tracking**: Current streak, longest streak, last workout
- **Exercise History**: Individual exercise progression over time

### 4. New UI Components:
- **📊 סטטיסטיקות**: Tabbed window with daily/weekly/levels stats
- **📈 היסטוריה**: Treeview showing detailed exercise history
- **🏆 שיאים**: Personal records and streak information
- **Auto-save**: Exercises automatically saved to database during conversation

### 5. Integration Points:
- `calculate_points()` now saves to database via `exercise_tracker.add_exercise()`
- `finish_workout()` ends session and shows duration/summary
- Hebrew-to-English exercise name mapping for database consistency
- Real-time streak updates from database

### 6. Data Persistence Features:
- All conversations with exercises are automatically recorded
- Timestamp accuracy to the second
- Session duration calculation
- Database indexes for fast queries
- Hebrew date formatting for UI display

## Usage Flow:
1. User mentions exercises in Hebrew conversation
2. System automatically starts session if none active
3. Exercises saved to database with points and timestamp
4. "Finish Workout" button ends session and shows summary
5. Statistics windows show comprehensive workout analytics

## Files Modified:
- **main_ui_final_gamified.py**: Added database integration and stats windows
- **exercise_tracker.py**: New comprehensive tracking system (NEW FILE)
- **run_enhanced_tracking.bat**: Launch script for enhanced version (NEW FILE)
