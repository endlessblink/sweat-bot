---**SweatBot Personal UI: Complete Session State & Next.js Upgrade Recommendation**

## Current Project Status (Aug 20, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks
- Fixed Deep Chat React integration failures (Web Components + SSR incompatibility)
- Switched from Groq to Gemini API for better Hebrew support
- Implemented custom React chat interface with Hebrew RTL and dark theme
- Created comprehensive Next.js chat UI library technical analysis
- Both servers running: FastAPI backend (port 8765) + Next.js frontend (port 4445)

### üîß Current Work
- Fixing voice feature: Updated `/api/voice` endpoint to handle UploadFile properly
- Voice endpoint was getting 422 errors due to incorrect parameter handling
- Frontend sends FormData, backend now expects `UploadFile = File(...)`

### üéØ Next.js Upgrade Recommendation (User Input)
User recommends upgrading from Next.js 14.2.5 to latest stable (15.4/15.5):
- **Benefits**: Better ESM compatibility, improved SSR/hydration, chat UI library support
- **Reason**: Many chat libraries target Next.js 15+ with newer APIs
- **Considerations**: Test thoroughly before production deployment
- **Impact**: Should resolve remaining Web Component integration issues

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Port Configuration Critical Rule
- PORT 3001 IS RESERVED - Never use for SweatBot services
- PORT 4444 may conflict - Use 4445 as alternative
- Personal UI currently runs on port 4445 successfully

### üìÇ Key File Locations
- Frontend: `/personal-ui/app/page.tsx` (287-line custom React implementation)
- Backend: `/personal_sweatbot_server.py` (FastAPI with voice endpoint)
- Agent: `/src/agents/personal_sweatbot.py` (Phidata + Gemini integration)
- Config: `.env` (GROQ_API_KEY commented out, GEMINI_API_KEY active)

### üéôÔ∏è Voice Feature Architecture
- Frontend: MediaRecorder ‚Üí FormData ‚Üí POST `/api/voice`
- Backend: UploadFile ‚Üí hebrew_model_manager ‚Üí Whisper transcription
- Issue: Import path for hebrew_model_manager needs verification
- Status: Backend fixed, testing required
