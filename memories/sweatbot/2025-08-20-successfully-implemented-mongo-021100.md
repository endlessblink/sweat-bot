---Successfully implemented MongoDB conversation persistence for SweatBot PersonalSweatBot

## What Was Accomplished
- Created `MongoDBMemory` class that inherits from Phidata's `AgentMemory`
- Integrated MongoDB with PersonalSweatBot for persistent conversation memory
- Implemented dual database architecture: MongoDB for conversations, PostgreSQL for exercises

## Technical Implementation
- **File**: `src/agents/mongodb_memory.py` - MongoDB memory wrapper with Phidata compatibility
- **Integration**: Updated `personal_sweatbot_enhanced.py` to use `MongoDBMemory(user_id="personal")`
- **Database**: Connected to `mongodb://sweatbot:secure_password@localhost:27017/`
- **Collections**: Uses `sweatbot_conversations.conversations` collection

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Session Management**: Automatic session creation with 2-hour timeout
2. **Conversation Search**: Full-text search with date filtering
3. **Analytics**: User preferences, exercise patterns, conversation stats
4. **Context Loading**: Loads recent conversations on bot startup
5. **Metadata Extraction**: Detects exercises, statistics requests, language

## Architecture Benefits
- **Persistent Memory**: Bot remembers all past conversations across restarts
- **Dual Storage**: Structured exercise data in PostgreSQL, unstructured conversations in MongoDB
- **Search Capabilities**: Can search conversation history for specific topics
- **Analytics**: Behavior pattern analysis for personalized coaching

## Testing Results
- ✅ MongoDB connection and message saving working correctly
- ✅ Phidata integration with proper inheritance and validation
- ✅ Conversation persistence across bot instances
- ✅ Exercise recognition and PostgreSQL integration maintained
- ✅ Real-time responses with persistent context

The user's original request to use MongoDB for conversation storage is now fully implemented and tested.
