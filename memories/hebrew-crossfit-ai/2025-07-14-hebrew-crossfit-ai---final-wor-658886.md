---Hebrew CrossFit AI - Final Working Solution

## Project Overview
Successfully created a Hebrew-enabled CrossFit AI automation system with real-time voice conversation, gamification, and accurate transcription.

## Key Components Created:

### 1. Main UI Versions:
- **main_ui_final_gamified.py** - FINAL WORKING VERSION with gamification
- **main_ui_final.py** - Working version with corrections, no gamification
- **main_ui_google_enhanced.py** - Enhanced with manual/auto modes
- **main_ui_google.py** - Google Speech Recognition version
- **main_ui_stable_final.py** - Stable Whisper version

### 2. Core Modules:
- **hebrew_voice_recognition.py** - Voice recognition with ivrit.ai/Whisper/Google fallbacks
- **hebrew_ai_coach.py** - AI coach with Gemini/Groq/OpenAI support
- **hebrew_workout_parser.py** - Hebrew workout command parser
- **hebrew_gamification.py** - Full gamification system
- **hebrew_tts_service.py** - Text-to-speech with multiple providers

### 3. Configuration:
- **.env** file with all API keys including:
  - GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyA05LBkE0_ZLb1JuavvkVe8OVgmo3xGfJ4
  - Plus Groq, OpenAI, ElevenLabs keys

### 4. Installation Scripts:
- **run_gamified.bat** - Run the final gamified version
- **run_final.bat** - Run without gamification
- **install_pyaudio_fixed.bat** - Fixed PyAudio installer

## Solutions Implemented:

### Transcription Accuracy:
- Hebrew text corrections dictionary (עזר→עשר, שמיכה→סמיכה)
- Google Speech Recognition for better Hebrew
- Adjustable sensitivity threshold
- Shows raw vs corrected text

### AI Response Issues:
- Direct Gemini API integration
- Strict 1-2 sentence limit (40-50 tokens max)
- Examples in system prompt
- No unnecessary encouragement

### Gamification System:
- Points per exercise (push-ups: 2, squats: 3, burpees: 5)
- 10-level progression system
- Workout streak tracking
- Real-time points calculation
- Achievements and stats

## Final Working Features:
1. Auto Hebrew chat with corrections
2. Very short, focused AI responses
3. Full gamification with points/levels
4. Workout tracking and parsing
5. Stats and achievements display
